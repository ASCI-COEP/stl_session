Determine all positive integers that evenly divide into a number, that is it's factors.
Return the pth element of your list, sorted ascending. If there is no pth element, return 0

For example, given number n = 20, it's factors are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}. Using 1-based indexing, if p = 3 return 4.
If p = 6, return 0

1 <= n <= 10 ^ 15
1 <= p <= 10 ^ 9


INPUT FORMAT: 
Each input contains 2 integers 'n' and 'p'.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each input, output a single integer denoting the pth factor.
